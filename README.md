This repository contains data and code associated with the research paper titled "Characterizing Spatial Patterns and Drivers of Biomass Carbon Density in Northeast Asia." The paper explores the spatial patterns and factors influencing biomass carbon density in Northeast Asia, utilizing multisource data from in situ forest inventories, remote sensing, bioclimatic, topographic, and human footprint data.

## Abstract

Forests play a crucial role in both regional and global carbon cycles. However, the spatial patterns of biomass carbon density and underlying factors in Northeast Asia have been unclear. In this study, we characterized spatial patterns and important drivers of biomass carbon density for Northeast Asia using high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) maps derived from in situ forest inventories, remote sensing, and various environmental datasets. The research estimates the current and future forest biomass carbon density and provides insights into the changes over the past two decades.

**Key Findings:**
- Current biomass carbon stock in northeastern China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Republic of Korea is estimated to be 2.53, 0.40, and 0.35 Pg C, respectively.
- Biomass carbon stock in Northeast Asia has increased by 20%–46% over the past 20 years, with a significant contribution from planted forests.
- Future estimates project biomass carbon stock to be 6.13 and 6.50 Pg C in 2080 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, indicating substantial growth compared to present values.

The spatial patterns of biomass carbon densities were found to vary greatly across Northeast Asia, influenced by factors such as mean diameter at breast height, dominant height, elevation, and human footprint. The results emphasize the effectiveness of reforestation and forest conservation efforts in expanding the carbon sink in the region.
